## Program Information and Background Readings

**Damien Riehl**
*Session Description*: Under copyright law, ideas are uncopyrightable, but human-made expressions are copyrightable — though machine-created expressions are uncopyrightable. Since LLM foundational models create vector embeddings — and those embeddings plot into vector space the conceptual  "ideas" — there's a strong argument that the LLM copyright lawsuits will fail because of copyright's Idea Expression Distinction. The potential fly in that ointment: Memorization without guardrails. Here an exploration of how in our Post-LLM world, Ideas are the only things that matter; Expressions are [uncopyrightable] commodities.

**Brian Ulicny**
*Session Description*: LLMs aren't trained on proprietary documents, so they can't answer questions about them. Their knowledge is also frozen when they are trained, making them unable to incorporate new information or to consider updates to sources.  They also aren't great at citing the basis of their answers accurately.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures were supposed to fix these deficiencies of LLMs by interacting with an updateable cache of potentially proprietary documents to augment their knowledge and provide sources for the answers they generate.  In this session, we discuss the extent to which RAG architectures rely only on retrieved documents to generate responses.  It turns out that RAG output tends to rely on parametric LLM memory rather than retrieved open-book sources.  To quantify this, we introduce a new legal question-answer dataset based on Defense contracting (DFARS) use cases.  Although these regulations are not proprietary, current LLMs are not able to answer professional-grade DFARS questions about them reliably or with appropriate citations.  We present results to show that although basic RAG architectures do not solve the problems described, they can be improved significantly by fine tuning both the retrieval and answer generation mechanisms.  We will end with a short demo of a system prototype.  

**Susan Guthrie**
*Session Description*:This program delves into the specific ways AI is currently revolutionizing mediation, enhancing communication, fostering resolution, and redefining conflict management, all within the framework of ethical considerations. We will explore real-world examples and case studies where AI tools have been effectively integrated into mediation processes, highlighting improvements in efficiency and the innovative generation of solutions for complex disputes. By integrating these advanced tools, mediators not only refine their practice but also elevate the overall stature and effectiveness of mediation as a profession. This program is a dive into marrying technological innovation with the art of mediation, ensuring that practitioners are at the forefront of ethical and effective conflict resolution.

**Allison Morrell**
*Session Description*: Sharing insights from building the Better GPT Builder and takeaways on 1) what GPTs (and other simple no code chatbot builders) are good for, and 2) a couple key techniques Allison has used to create structured interaction and outputs with only plain text instructions.

**Leonard Park**
*Session Description*: How much should I be tipping ChatGPT? Should I motivate my LLM with praise or threaten it with annihilation? I like to make tests in Colab Notebooks to try and answer questions like this. There’s a near-constant stream of research articles and news coverage about LLMs, and their surprising behaviors. Along with the blistering pace of genAI advancements, it's difficult to know if certain findings are real, and if real, meaningful for any practical application. Further complicating the issue is that LLMs behave differently across specific domains, such as legal language. So, let’s try some experiments in legal contexts and then reach our own conclusions.
