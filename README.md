## Program Information and Background Readings

**Damien Riehl**
- *Bio*: Damien Riehl is a lawyer and technologist with experience in complex litigation, digital forensics, and software development. A coder since 1985 and for the web since 1995, Damien clerked for the chief judges of state and federal courts, practiced in complex litigation for over a decade, has led teams of cybersecurity and world-spanning digital forensics investigations, and has led teams in legal-software development. An appointee of the Minnesota Governor’s Council on Connected and Automated Vehicles, he has helped recommend changes to Minnesota statutes, rules, and policies — all related to connected and autonomous vehicles. Damien is Chair of the Minnesota State Bar Association's working group on AI and the Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL). At SALI, the legal data standard he helps lead, Damien develops and has greatly expanded the taxonomy of over 14,000 legal tags that matter, helping the legal industry's development of Generative AI, analytics, and interoperability. At vLex Group — which includes Fastcase, NextChapter, and Docket Alarm — Damien helps lead the design, development, and expansion of various products, integrating AI-backed technologies (e.g., GPT) to improve legal workflows and to power legal data analytics. “This guy [Damien] rocks!” - Elon Musk
- *Session Description*: Under copyright law, ideas are uncopyrightable, but human-made expressions are copyrightable — though machine-created expressions are uncopyrightable. Since LLM foundational models create vector embeddings — and those embeddings plot into vector space the conceptual  "ideas" — there's a strong argument that the LLM copyright lawsuits will fail because of copyright's Idea Expression Distinction. The potential fly in that ointment: Memorization without guardrails. Here an exploration of how in our Post-LLM world, Ideas are the only things that matter; Expressions are [uncopyrightable] commodities.

**Todd Smithline**
- *Bio*: Todd Smithline is CEO and Founder of Bonterms. Prior to Bonterms Todd was general counsel of Marimba, an enterprise software company he helped take from start-up to successful public company and was Managing Principal of Smithline PC, a boutique law firm that represented a who’s-who list of leading Silicon Valley companies and pioneered fixed-fee subscription pricing. He started his career with Latham & Watkins and Gunderson Dettmer. Todd teaches Fundamentals of Technology Transactions and Video Game Law at UC Berkeley School of Law and is a board member or advisor to multiple start-ups.

**Brian Ulicny**
- *Session Description*: LLMs aren't trained on proprietary documents, so they can't answer questions about them. Their knowledge is also frozen when they are trained, making them unable to incorporate new information or to consider updates to sources.  They also aren't great at citing the basis of their answers accurately.  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures were supposed to fix these deficiencies of LLMs by interacting with an updateable cache of potentially proprietary documents to augment their knowledge and provide sources for the answers they generate.  In this session, we discuss the extent to which RAG architectures rely only on retrieved documents to generate responses.  It turns out that RAG output tends to rely on parametric LLM memory rather than retrieved open-book sources.  To quantify this, we introduce a new legal question-answer dataset based on Defense contracting (DFARS) use cases.  Although these regulations are not proprietary, current LLMs are not able to answer professional-grade DFARS questions about them reliably or with appropriate citations.  We present results to show that although basic RAG architectures do not solve the problems described, they can be improved significantly by fine tuning both the retrieval and answer generation mechanisms.  We will end with a short demo of a system prototype.  

**Susan Guthrie**

- *Session Description*:This program delves into the specific ways AI is currently revolutionizing mediation, enhancing communication, fostering resolution, and redefining conflict management, all within the framework of ethical considerations. We will explore real-world examples and case studies where AI tools have been effectively integrated into mediation processes, highlighting improvements in efficiency and the innovative generation of solutions for complex disputes. By integrating these advanced tools, mediators not only refine their practice but also elevate the overall stature and effectiveness of mediation as a profession. This program is a dive into marrying technological innovation with the art of mediation, ensuring that practitioners are at the forefront of ethical and effective conflict resolution.

**Allison Morrell**

She presently focuses on process improvement and helping lawyers get more value from technology, including e-discovery and effective use of document databases, knowledge management systems, and training programs for lawyers and law firm staff. Allison obtained her law and undergraduate degrees from the University of British Columbia and was called to the bar in 2018. Allison is also a co-founder of a non-profit legal technology start-up that is working on improving the client intake process. She is a self-taught programmer and enthusiastic about taking advantage of legal knowledge as data, and the application of AI to litigation workflows.
- *Session Description*: Sharing insights from building the Better GPT Builder and takeaways on 1) what GPTs (and other simple no code chatbot builders) are good for, and 2) a couple key techniques Allison has used to create structured interaction and outputs with only plain text instructions.

**Leonard Park**
- *Bio*: Leo is an attorney and legal tech product manager who spent eight years developing legal analytics at Lex Machina. He is currently advising a number of legal tech startups while planning his next move.
- *Session Description*: How much should I be tipping ChatGPT? Should I motivate my LLM with praise or threaten it with annihilation? I like to make tests in Colab Notebooks to try and answer questions like this. There’s a near-constant stream of research articles and news coverage about LLMs, and their surprising behaviors. Along with the blistering pace of genAI advancements, it's difficult to know if certain findings are real, and if real, meaningful for any practical application. Further complicating the issue is that LLMs behave differently across specific domains, such as legal language. So, let’s try some experiments in legal contexts and then reach our own conclusions.
